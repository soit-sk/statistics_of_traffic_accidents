Detailed statistic about traffic accidents in Czech republic.

Forked from https://classic.scraperwiki.com/scrapers/statistics_of_traffic_accidents/

The script gets total statistics for each day. Not for day from database, but for

Use statistics_of_traffic_accidents_all instead.

*TODO:* Use POST to fetch entire history for the year.
